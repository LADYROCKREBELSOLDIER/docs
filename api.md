Use the StageBloc API to develop custom, standalone integrations with StageBloc.

### Under Development
The API (and therefore these docs) are still currently under development. Initially the API will be read only.

# General Information
The root URL of the API is at `https://api.stagebloc.com/2.0/`.

Responses can be given in either JSON or XML form by simply changing the extension of the endpoint between .xml and .json.

# Authorization
Connecting with the StageBloc API uses the OAuth 2.0 standard.

# Wrappers
There is currently a PHP wrapper available for connecting with the API. It can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/stagebloc/php-sb-connect). Instructions for how to use it are included in the `README` file of that repository.

If you want to create your own wrapper in another language, please do! Let us know, and we can link to it from here.
