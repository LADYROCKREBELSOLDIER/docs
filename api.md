Use the StageBloc API to develop custom, standalone integrations with StageBloc.

### Under Development
The API (and therefore these docs) are still currently under development. That means that there will be changes made, so if you're planning on using the API, check back here for updates and changes frequently.

### Fork us on GitHub!
All of StageBloc's documentation are up on GitHub for you to fork, modify, and improve. Join us over there to request features, add suggestions, and report bugs. What are you waiting for? [Git to it!](https://github.com/stagebloc/docs)

# General Information
The root URL of the API is `https://api.stagebloc.com/2.0/`.

Responses can be formatted in either JSON or XML by simply changing the extension of the endpoint between `.xml` and `.json`. For instance, to list an accounts blog entries, you could use either `/blog/list.xml` or `/blog/list.json`.

### Authorization
Connecting with the StageBloc API uses the OAuth 2.0 standard. You must first register your application in the StageBloc backend to receive a client ID and secret that will allow users to connect with your application.

### Wrappers
There is currently a PHP wrapper available for connecting with the API. It can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stagebloc/php-stagebloc-api). Instructions for how to use it are included in the `README` file of that repository.

If you want to create your own wrapper in another language, please do! Let us know, and we can link to it from here.
